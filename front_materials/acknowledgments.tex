In the quiet moments of reflection, as I pen down these acknowledgements, my heart overflows with profound gratitude. This journey, culminating in the pages of this dissertation, has been illuminated by the wisdom, support, and encouragement of many extraordinary souls.

Foremost in my heart is gratitude for Dr. Kelley Kidwell, whose guidance was the compass by which I navigated this journey. Dr. Kidwell, you have been more than an advisor; you have been a mentor, a supporter, and an inspiration. Your empathetic approach, combined with your academic acumen, has not only guided my academic pursuits but also shaped my personal ethos. Your ability to see the world from a student's perspective, your considerate nature, and your unyielding support have been the bedrock of my PhD experience. For this, and for the wonderful life lessons, I owe you a debt of gratitude that mere words cannot express.

To the esteemed members of my committee—Dr. Thomas Braun, Dr. Daniel Hertz, and Dr. Min Zhang—thank you for your invaluable insights and constructive feedback. Your contributions have been instrumental in shaping my academic narrative.

A special word of thanks to Dr. Satrajit Roychoudhury, whose expertise and guidance in the realm of Bayesian methods and research strategies have profoundly impacted my work. Your approach to research and your extensive knowledge have been a source of inspiration and learning.

A heartfelt thanks to Dan Barker, Michael Kleinsasser, and Dr. Roy Tamura, whose assistance with my projects was invaluable. And to my classmates and study groups, thank you for the shared struggles and triumphs, for the laughter and the late nights, and for all the moments in between that have enriched this journey.

The academic path is rarely walked alone, and I have been fortunate to be guided by many luminaries along the way. To Drs. Nicholas Henderson, Veera Baladandayuthapani, Jennifer Smith, Xiang Zhou, and many others, your encouragement, wisdom, and support have been pivotal at many crossroads in my life. 

To Drs. Fang Fang and Holly Hartman, thank you for sharing the code and methodologies that laid the groundwork for my own research. Your generosity has been a beacon of collaborative spirit.

The administrative staff in the Biostatistics office deserves immense thanks for their behind-the-scenes work that made my journey smoother. Your reminders, guidance, and support have been indispensable.

And to my friends and family, especially Richard Higgins, Xuelin Gu, Di Wang, Kaiwei Lei, and my pillars of strength, Mom and Dad—your unwavering support, love, and belief in me have been my greatest source of motivation. You've nurtured my spirit and shaped my character, making me a better researcher and human being.

This dissertation represents not just my work, but the collective effort, support, and love of everyone mentioned here and many more. I'm deeply thankful for every one of you. This journey would have been much harder and lonelier without your support. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
